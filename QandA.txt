1. Explain the overall design of your program and justify why you chose this particular class structure and set of user-defined methods.

:This Program is just a simple Library System built around one main class, LibraryBook,
which represents a single book with user-defined attributes
(book ID, title, author, availability flag, and a borrow-history list). 
This design clearly shows OOP by keeping related data and behavior together in one object, 
making the code easy to understand and extend. The methods model real library actions: 
borrow() and return_book() change the book’s state and record events, while get_status(),
display_info(), and show_history() provide controlled, 
readable access to the internal data without exposing the attributes directly.



2. Describe how user input is handled in your program and discuss the role of exception handling (try–except) in preventing incorrect or unexpected behavior.

:User input is handled by helper functions that loop until valid data is entered. get_string_input() prevents empty strings for required values
(ID, title, author, borrower), and get_choice_input() ensures the menu choice 
is one of the allowed options so invalid commands do not break the menu.
Exception handling (try–except) stops bad input and invalid actions from crashing the 
program: the constructor raises ValueError for missing details, 
and borrow() / return_book() catch errors like borrowing an already-borrowed book
or returning an available one, then show a clear message instead of a traceback. 
The input helper also handles KeyboardInterrupt so pressing Ctrl+C cancels cleanly.




3. Identify one limitation of your current implementation and explain how it could be improved using additional OOP concepts or better error handling.

:A key limitation is that the program manages only one LibraryBook at a time,
so it does not model a real library with many books. 
This could be improved by adding a Library class that holds multiple LibraryBook objects
(for example, in a dictionary keyed by book ID), 
demonstrating composition (“a Library has many Books”) 
and enabling features like listing, searching, and borrowing by ID.
Error handling could also be enhanced by enforcing unique book IDs 
and by saving timestamps in the borrow history to make the log more
informative and realistic.
